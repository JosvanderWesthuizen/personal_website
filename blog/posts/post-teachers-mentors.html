          Best teachers don't teach. Good mentors let you ask the right questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          While practicing Brazilian jiu jitsu I learned another lesson. The best teachers won't teach voluntarily
          because they are wise enough not to assume that they are smarter than you. After sparring sessions, I caught
          myself instinctively giving feedback, but then it dawned on me: what if they were more experienced than me and
          just had an off roll?
        </p>

        <p>
          That made me realize the importance of explicitly asking for tips and feedback, like Michael Jordan did after
          each training session - run back to the coach and ask what you can do better. And it's surprising how well
          this works, everyone opens up when asked what I can do better next time. I.e. maintain a habit of being humble
          and asking for feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a related note, while tapping a soccerball outside, I was reminded of when I was younger and when I would
          spend allotted time on multiple sports each weekend, trying to hone my skills for all sports. It took me 10
          years to reflect and realize that I should have focussed on one thing only.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I had a mentor or elders who could ask me about my thoughts and rationale, they would be able to steer my
          logic and make me realize my own mistakes earlier. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why many of the greats
          like Alexander the Great had aristocratic mentors assigned from a young age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading also helps a lot for the above, and seeing discussions between really smart people. I keep thinking
          back to hearing Bill Gates and Buffet talk about "focus". Spending time in the words of the wise does a really
          good job to mitigate issues as well.
