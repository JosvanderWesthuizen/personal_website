        <p>
          My friend introduced me to an interesting notion that his grandfather shared. Most people think that they
          don't have enough time in the week, but it's not time that is the problem, it's using the time we have more
          effectively. There are 168 hours in a week of which 112 hours are spent awake. People usually work 60 hours a week and
          sit in front of the TV for the remaining 52 hours in order to "rest up" for the next 60-hour week.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason we cannot effectively use all the hours in the week is because we trade our energy for money. If
          possible, you should only do activities that increase your energy or use it on your most valuable skill. I.e.
          trade spend money to save energy, which saves time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people, especially some highly skilled folks in large tech companies, make the mistake of trying to save
          money to do certain tasks themselves instead of hiring someone more skilled to do it. An example is mowing the
          lawn. An engineer at Google should not spend any time mowing the lawn because it's not within their core
          competencies and it's going to drain their energy. Unless they enjoy mowing the lawn and it energizes them.
        </p>

        <p>
          To be your best self, you should aim to delegate and outsource all activities that drain your energy and don't
          push you toward your goals. In addition, you should increase the frequency of energizing activities in your
          week e.g. exercise.
        </p>

        <p>This way we can all be more productive without being more industrious.</p>
