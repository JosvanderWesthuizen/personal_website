          I was so set on being successful that I tried to find patterns in everything in order to optimize my life for
          success. What you end up doing is scheduling all the little things to become a well-rounded person, but that
          works against your success. To become successful (in the capitalistic billion-dollar founder instantiation of
          it), you need to become ultra obsessed with the industry and problem. Scheduling 30 minutes every day for
          something like reading and maths distracts you from obsession and makes you a generalist.
        </p>

        <p>
          I picked up this scheduling habit after reflecting on my life as a student, but life as a student is already
          very scheduled and the only way to beat that schedule is to schedule time for the good things. School doesn't
          make it easy to become obsessed because it keeps making you balance your time with different subjects each
          day.

          The same could be said for addiction. Maybe addiction is a good thing because it allows you to go really deep
          on something. Obviously this is bad if you're addicted to something degenerate like alcohol or meth, but if
          it's something good for the rest of humanity, if you're producing and not consuming, then getting addicted and
          obsessed could be insanely good.
        </p>

          Everyone is always sharpening their blades for the battle that will never happen. Instead of trying to be good
          at everything, it might be better to be great at one thing -- ideally the thing that you're already spending
          most of your time on.
