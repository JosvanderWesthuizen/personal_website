        <p>I think I learned a lesson early in life that many people have experienced, but perhaps not noticed.</p>

        <p>
          It goes something like this; when growing up in school and doing basic mathematics, your multiplication and
          division skills are sharp. Then as soon as you enter university and use a calculator for most basic
          mathematics, your brain gets slower with that activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same effect can be said for writing essays. When applying to scholarships, I would often copy a lot of
          what I had written before and simply change a few words. This made my brain lazy and I never developed a
          strong skill for reasoning and quickly making good arguments for why I should get a scholarship.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now with chatGPT, a lot of people can use it much like a calculator. You can enter a phrase and without
          thinking, let the AI think for you to come up with email prose or blog post. If my previous observations are
          true, then a lot of us will lose our writing and reasoning skills.
        </p>

        <p>[So, how do we solve this?</p>

        <p>
          There are 2 approaches I've been able to come up with thus far. The first is to ensure that your work requires
          you to]
        </p>

        <p>This lead me to the following corollary.</p>

        <p>
          If it's inevitable that our brain power will atrophy given our tech aid and if you want to keep your brain
          power for whatever reason (maybe brain power is useless), then you really only have 2 options:
        </p>

        <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
            Ensure that your daily work includes intellectual work that racks your brain. Be careful, because most work
            even if you're a programmer doesn't really rack your brain – an extreme example is using chatGPT to generate
            code for you.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
            Set aside time every week where you deliberately train your brain, whether it's basic maths or writing
            essays.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Ultimately, you'll want to do your dayjob as efficiently as possible, so you really only have one option which
          is to set aside time for deliberate practice.
        </p>

        <h2>Maybe we don't need these skills that are being replaced?</h2>

        <p>"The strongest species is that which is able to adapt the fastest" - darwin (check)</p>

        <p>
          That is afterall human's biggest strength. So another angle on this might be to leverage your calculator,
          copy-paste, and chatGPT as much as you can to buy yourself time for developing your brain in the areas that
          aren't automated yet.
