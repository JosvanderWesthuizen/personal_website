        <p>
          I recently asked a postdoc friend what they would have done differently if they had redone their PhD. Their
          answer was similar to mine, so I thought I'd write it out here in case any early PhDs would find it useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing both of us would do differently is to spend more time making our research efficient. You'd often
          work really hard one month to get all your experiments and data gathering done while in the back of your mind
          knowing that if you spent 4 hours learning a new piece of software, you could automate all the work for the
          rest of the month. And thus get back to new work instead of doing grunt work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus far my best solution has been to listen to that voice in the back of my head and start working on things
          that aren't direct work, but could make your direct work much more efficient. I also set aside time every week
          for tinkering on ideas that might teach me something new or make me more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most people reading this will already be working as hard as humanly possible -- 100 hours a week. The next
          level is continually working smarter.
