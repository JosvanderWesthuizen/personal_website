          One thing I've found difficult in the era of agent coding is context
          switching. Instead of getting into a flow state, you're constantly
          waiting for AI to finish a task.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before agent codingtyping speed was the bottleneck. You'd keep a
          problem in your head for hours as you methodically implemented the
          solution, line by line. Your brain stayed in one place because your
          hands couldn't go any faster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's what happened: I'd be working on a feature, fire off an AI agent to implement a component, and then... 
          sit there. Waiting. The agent takes maybe five minutes. Not long enough to start something meaningful, but too 
          long to just stare at the screen. So I'd context switch. Check email. Start thinking about another problem. 
          Then the agent finishes, and now I need to reload the entire mental model of what I was working on to review 
          its output.

          Most developers I know turn to emails, messages, reddit, or games while they wait for AI. I wonder if you could keep firing off multiple tasks and multi-task between them, which is probably what the TikTok generation is perfectly trained for.
        </p>


        <h2>The TikTok Generation Was Training for This</h2>

        <p>
          Then it hit me: maybe this isn't a bug, it's a feature. Maybe this workflow is perfectly designed for a 
          generation that grew up on TikTok.
        </p>

        <p>
          We love to bemoan short attention spans. "Kids these days can't focus for more than 30 seconds!" But what if 
          those rapid context switches aren't a weakness – what if they're training? What if scrolling through dozens of 
          disparate videos, each requiring a quick mental reset, is actually the perfect preparation for an AI-augmented 
          workflow?
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about what working with AI agents actually requires: You need to quickly understand a problem, articulate 
          it clearly, dispatch an agent, shift your attention to something else, then rapidly context switch back when 
          it's done. Rinse and repeat, dozens of times a day. You're not going deep on one thing anymore – you're 
          orchestrating multiple agents across multiple tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>From Deep Work to Wide Work</h2>

        <p>
          The old way was vertical. You went deep on one problem. The new way is horizontal. You manage a portfolio of 
          problems simultaneously, each at different stages of completion. It's less about sustained focus and more about 
          rapid task switching with minimal cognitive overhead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sound familiar? It's exactly what happens when you scroll TikTok. You watch a cooking video, then a political 
          rant, then a dance challenge, then someone explaining quantum physics. Each one requires you to rapidly 
          understand context, extract value, and move on. Your brain gets trained to do this efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe TikTok didn't destroy a generation's attention span. Maybe it accidentally trained them for the future 
          of knowledge work. While we were worrying about kids not being able to read long-form content, they were 
          developing the exact skill set needed to manage multiple AI agents: context switching without losing the plot.
        </p>

        <h2>The Irony</h2>

        <p>
          There's something deliciously ironic about this. We spent the last decade decrying social media's effect on 
          attention spans. All those think pieces about how we're losing our ability to focus, how we're becoming 
          scattered and shallow. And it turns out that the very thing we were worried about might be the thing that 
          prepares us for the next paradigm of work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not saying deep focus is dead or that we should all embrace shallow thinking. Long-form thought still 
          matters. But I am saying that maybe we've been too quick to dismiss rapid context switching as purely negative. 
          Like most things, it's a tool. And for working with AI agents, it might be exactly the right tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          So perhaps the next time I'm sitting there, waiting for an agent to finish, rolling my thumbs and feeling 
          frustrated about the fragmented workflow, I should remember: somewhere out there, a 19-year-old who grew up 
          on TikTok is doing this effortlessly. While I'm struggling to adapt, they're thriving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evolution happens in unexpected ways. Maybe TikTok's infinite scroll wasn't cultural decay after all. Maybe it 
          was preparation.
